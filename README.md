# Detection of cases of dishonest exam taking
This project is aimed to find out students, who used someone's help to write an exam.
I used a data with students' statistics that helped me to analyse the key factors and determine suspicious details in their behaviour.

# Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn

# Conclusion
To sum up, it was a great experience, because this is my first time working with data.
During this project, I've learnt basics of data analysis and used Pandas and Seaborn in practice for the first time.
While working with Pandas and Seaborn, I've trained in grouping, merging, aggregating and in visualising the data.
